# Augmented-Reality-Zombie
This repository contains the APK file needed to use this AR experience.

Rational: This Augmented Reality application provides an interactive immersive AR based experience using Unity3D, Vuforia, Visual Studio and Android Studio. The application allows a user to control a zombie with a virtual joystick for movement and a button to make the zombie attack. The main target audience is English speaking users in the 13+ age group.

I performed an audience analysis of the potential users and did some research on AR applications. I then created a poster to be used as the AR marker and began creating the application in Unity. I created the code and scripts needed in Visual Studio. Once the application was finished and build, I pushed it to github and created a web page describing the app and how to use it.

I used three different pieces of software to create this project, Abobe PhotoShop, Unity 3D and Vuforia, and Android studio. I used photoshop to create the poster to be used as the image target which features a QR code. When the QR code is scanned it takes the user to a Website landing page which instructs them on how to use the application and provides them with the APK needed to run the application. I used unity 3D to create the application and Android Studio to build the APK.
